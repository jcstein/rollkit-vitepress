# GM world frontend tutorial

In this tutorial, we'll learn how to use [Cosmology](https://cosmology.tech/) to
create a frontend for our [GM world](../gm-world) rollup.

Cosmology enables developers to build web3 apps in the Interchain Ecosystem.
With Cosmology, it's simple to begin building apps that communicate with
Cosmos SDK and CosmWasm chains.

We'll be using `create-cosmos-app` in this tutorial to scaffold
a frontend and add the chain information for our rollup.

In the end, you'll have something that looks like this
[demo](https://rollkit-frontend.vercel.app)
([repo](https://github.com/jcstein/rollkit-frontend)).

## Getting started

In order to complete this tutorial you will need to have completed
the [GM world tutorial](../gm-world). This requires a running rollup
on your local machine.

## Setting up the frontend

Now that you have your rollup running, you are ready to scaffold
the frontend! In your terminal, first install `create-cosmos-app`:

```bash
npm install -g create-cosmos-app
```

Now scaffold an app:

```bash
create-cosmos-app
```

In this tutorial, we're using the following setting and your output
will look similar to this if everything is successful:

```bash
? [name] Enter your new app name gm-world
Cloning into 'gm-world'...
? [template] which template connect-multi-chain
yarn install v1.22.19
[1/4] Resolving packages...
[2/4] Fetching packages...
[3/4] Linking dependencies...
[4/4] Building fresh packages...
success Saved lockfile.
Done in 42.23s.

✨ Have fun! Now you can start on your project ⚛️

Now, run this command:

cd ./gm-world && yarn dev
```

Follow the instructions at the end of the output to start your app:

```bash
cd ./gm-world && yarn dev
```

## Adding your GM portal chain to the config

First, we'll need to make some changes with the default config.

We need to add the array of chains that we would like to test
in the `components/wallet.tsx` file on underneath imports:

```tsx
const allowedChains = [
  'gmrollup',
  'celestiatestnet',
  'celestiatestnet2',
  'celestiatestnet3',
];
```

In `chainOptions` change `chainRecords` this to show only the allowed chains
from your array:

```tsx title="hi"
chainRecords
      .filter((chainRecord) => allowedChains.includes(chainRecord.name))
      .map((chainRecord) => {
```

In `configs/defaults.ts` change `defaultChainName` to:

```tsx
export const defaultChainName = 'gmrollup';
```

Now you're ready to see only the chains you've selected, but first, we need
to set up the config for `gmrollup`!

In the `config` directory, create a new file called `chain.ts`. This will
be your config for your GM rollup.

In that file, put the following:

```tsx
export const chain = {
    "$schema": "../../chain.schema.json",
    "chain_name": "gmrollup",
    "chain_id": "gm",
    "pretty_name": "my gm rollup",
    "status": "live",
    "network_type": "testnet",
    "bech32_prefix": "gm",
    "daemon_name": "gmd",
    "node_home": "$HOME/.gm",
    "key_algos": [
      "secp256k1"
    ],
    "slip44": 118,
    "fees": {
      "fee_tokens": [
        {
          "denom": "ustake",
          "fixed_min_gas_price": 0
        }
      ]
    },
    "apis": {
      "rpc": [
        {
          "address": "http://localhost:26657",
          "provider": "JCS"
        }
      ],
      "rest": [
        {
          "address": "http://localhost:1317",
          "provider": "JCS"
        }
      ]
    },
    "beta": true,
  }
  ```

Create a new file in `config` called `assetlist.ts` and add the following:

```tsx
export const assetlist = {
    "$schema": "../../assetlist.schema.json",
    "chain_name": "gmrollup",
    "assets": [
      {
        "description": "",
        "denom_units": [
          {
            "denom": "ustake",
            "exponent": 0
          },
          {
            "denom": "stake",
            "exponent": 6
          }
        ],
        "base": "stake",
        "name": "GM rollup",
        "display": "stake",
        "symbol": "STAKE",
        "logo_URIs": {
          "svg": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jcstein/gm-portal/b030ce3fe548d188fbacb6b932d7e51dc7afd65e/frontend/public/gm.svg"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
```

Create a new file in `config` directory called `defaults.ts`:

```tsx
import { assets } from 'chain-registry';
import { AssetList, Asset } from '@chain-registry/types';

export const defaultChainName = 'gmrollup';

export const getChainAssets = (chainName: string = defaultChainName) => {
  return assets.find((chain) => chain.chain_name === chainName) as AssetList;
};

export const getCoin = (chainName: string = defaultChainName) => {
  const chainAssets = getChainAssets(chainName);
  return chainAssets.assets[0] as Asset;
};
```

In `_app.tsx` you can now import `assetlist` and `chain` with your
new GM config!

```tsx
# other imports
import { chain } from "../config/chain"
import { assetlist } from "../config/assetlist"

# rest of code
```

Then, modify your `ChainProvider`:

```tsx
<ChainProvider
        chains={[...chains, chain]}
        assetLists={[...assets, assetlist]}
        wallets={[...keplrWallets, ...cosmostationWallets, ...leapWallets]}
        walletConnectOptions={{
          signClient: {
            projectId: 'a8510432ebb71e6948cfd6cde54b70f7',
            relayUrl: 'wss://relay.walletconnect.org',
            metadata: {
              name: 'Celestia + Cosmos SDK',
              description: 'Celestia + Cosmos SDK',
              url: 'https://docs.celestia.org/',
              icons: [],
            },
          },
        }}
        endpointOptions={{
          isLazy: true
        }}
        wrappedWithChakra={true}
        signerOptions={signerOptions}
      >
```

You may notice that we added:

```tsx
endpointOptions={{isLazy: true}}
```

This will save our localhost RPC from being overridden.

Congratulations! You now have a frontend for your rollup.
What features do you want to add now?

You may notice that the icons for Celestia testnets are not loading,
this is due to an outdated version of the chain registry.

![cca.png](/gm/cca.png)

To update
these, you can use your terminal:

```bash
cd $HOME && cd gm-world
yarn upgrade-interactive --latest
```

Select `@chain-registry/types` by using arrow keys and the spacebar
to select it. Do the same with `@cosmos-kit/core`, `@cosmos-kit
cosmostation`, `@cosmos-kit/keplr`, `@cosmos-kit/leap`,
`@cosmos-kit/react`, `@chain-registry/cosmostation` and
`chain-registry`.

Now use enter to upgrade the dependencies!

Head back to your frontend and take a look, you should see the
updated icons.
