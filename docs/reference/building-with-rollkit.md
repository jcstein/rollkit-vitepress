# Building with Rollkit

While Rollkit is a modular framework that aims to be compatible with
a wide range of data availability layers, settlement layers, and
execution environments, the most supported development environment
is building on Celestia as a data availability layer.

## Building from source

### Dependencies

* Requires Go version >= 1.19

To build:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/rollkit/rollkit.git
cd rollkit 
go build -v ./...
```

## Building on Celestia

There are currently 2 ways to build on Celestia:

1. Using a local development environment with [local-celestia-devnet](https://github.com/rollkit/local-celestia-devnet)
2. Using the Arabica or Mocha Celestia testnets*
