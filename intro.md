# Introduction to Rollkit

This is a draft.

Welcome to the Rollkit docs. We're happy you made it here!

Rollkit is the open modular framework for sovereign rollups.

Our mission is to empower developers to quickly innovate and create entire new classes of rollups with minimal tradeoffs.

We're setting the bar high for developers' flexibility and ability to customize rollups however they see fit.

::: tip
In order to use Rollkit, it's important to have some
familiarity with Cosmos SDK. You can get up to speed
on Cosmos SDK by visiting their [official documentation page](https://docs.cosmos.network/main).

If you're familiar with Rollkit, you may want to skip to the [tutorials section](../tutorials).
